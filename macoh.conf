#### The working directory.
# This will be used to download and place all files. Will be created if it
# doesn't exist. Make surfe you have write permissions in the parent dir.
home=~/macoh

### Wait time before and after the test
# waitstart is used to capture idle temperature, don't set to 0.
# waitend is useful to see how quickly it cools off.
# Pertinent values for both: 15-30 sec.
waitstart=15 		# wait time before test (seconds)
waitend=15 			# wait time after test (seconds)

### Intel Power Gadget polling period (milliseconds)
ipgpoll=500

### FFT options
# Duration is in seconds
fftsize=2048			# N, applies a 2D FFT on a random 2D N-by-N matrix
fftduration=300			# duration (seconds)
fftthreads=0 			# -1 = nr of physical cores minus 1 (auto)
						# 0 = max threads (auto, 2xPhyCores if HyperThreaded)
						# n = use n > 0 threads
ffttype=0
fftwisdom=0

### GpuTest options
# gputest can be: fur, tess_x8, tess_x16, tess_x32, tess_x64, gi,
#                   pixmark_piano, pixmark_volplosion, plot3d, triangle.
gputest=tess_x64		# see above
gpumsaa=2 				# 0,2,4,8 ... 0 disables MSAA
gpuwidth=1280 			# width (pixels)
gpuheight=720 			# height (pixels)
gpuduration=600         # duration (seconds)

### Prime95 options
# In-place FFTs are the most stressful. Larger FFTs (e.g. 128k or more)
# are even more stressful.
p95min=8				# Min FFT size (k)
p95max=8				# Max FFT size (k)
p95mem=0 				# FFT memory (MB), 0 = in-place
p95time=5				# time for each FFT (minutes)
p95duration=300			# test duration (seconds)

### User command options
# Max duration in seconds, 0=indefinte (if the user command stops by itself
# then set this to either 0 or a sufficiently high value)
usercmdduration=300

### Niceness (CPU priority) of FFT, HandBrake, GpuTest, Prime95.
# An integer between -19 and 20. Negative values (less nice) means more CPU
# priority, i.e. -19 means the highest priority (usually reserved for critical
# OS processes). If you intend to run both HandBrake and GpuTest at the same
# time then set both to the same nice level.
# NOTE: You should *not* set this to more than 0 or else all other processes
#       which default to 0 will trump the stress tests which won't be able to
#       push the CPU as much, and result in misleading temp/freq results.
# NOTE2: The Prime95 nice level is only for the master process. The child
#        processes are nice'd automatically.
fftnice=-10
hbnice=-10
gpunice=-10
p95nice=0

### Various 
# Output of HandBrake (transcoded movie). Set it to an actual file if you
# want it saved (e.g. "$home/transcoded.mkv"). By default it goes into 
# /dev/null to avoid any disk I/O
mkv=/dev/null

# Quit main menu after running a test? 1=yes, 0=no
menuquit=0
